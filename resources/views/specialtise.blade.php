OBJECTIVES OF DEGREE PROGRAMME
The Department seeks to provide quality instruction at undergraduate level. It also
encourages hands-on, which would enable its graduates to be able to harness forces and
exploit resources so that they can be instruments for development. In this respect, the
undergraduate courses lay emphasis on the teaching of basic Engineering principles and
on the applications of various Engineering concepts, enhanced by practical sessions.
The department also offers a professional Higher National Diploma (HND) programme
in two years. The specific objectives for the Computer Networks and system
maintenance are:
- To produce graduates who are well-educated in the fundamental concepts of
Computer Networks and systems maintenance;
- To produce graduates who are capable of continuing their professional
development throughout their career by combining theory with its application in
Computer Engineering practice;
- To build human resource capacity in the Computer Network and system
maintenance discipline in both the public and private sectors to students who
wish to become proficient in developing Computer networks in a variety of
platforms using a methodical approach;
SKILLS TO BE ACQUIRED:
At the end of the programme, the following skills should be acquired:
- Ability to understand sophisticated techniques in PC repair, including external I/O
devices, printers, mobile computing devices, purchasing and building PCs,
troubleshooting, support, virus protection, data protection, and recovery.repair
and main.
- Ability to understand how computers communicate with each other, how
computers are grouped together to form networks, networking concepts and
issues that are key to the successful implementation of computer networks, and
the different networking implementation strategies and technologies currently
available.
